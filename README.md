# Extreme Sudoku #
This is an advanced Sudoku project - named "Extreme Sudoku", which @yalibeta and I have programmed in c language.
The project was submitted as the final project for the "Software Project" course - A course we took in the second year of our Computer Science degree at Tel Aviv University.
The project guidelines appear in a pdf next to this README. You are free to clone, play, and give us feedback :)
Enjoy!
