# Extreme Sudoku #
This a complicated Sudoku project - named "Extreme Sudoku", which me and @yali have programmed in c language.
The project was made as part of the course "Software Project" - we took in the second year of our Computer Science degree at Tel Aviv University.
The project guidelines appear in a pdf aside from this README. You are free to clone, play, and give us feedback :)
Enjoy!
